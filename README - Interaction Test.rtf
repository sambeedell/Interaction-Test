\
This application features the ability to measure touch velocity, which affects the timbre and loudness characteristics of the sound. \
\
The application can also measure continuous gestures for example, natural vibrato is achieved by rocking your finger horizontally and timbre modulation is achieved by rocking your finger vertically. Furthermore, if the device is held in the users hand, rotating the device will affect the reverb amount and increase spatial depth.}
